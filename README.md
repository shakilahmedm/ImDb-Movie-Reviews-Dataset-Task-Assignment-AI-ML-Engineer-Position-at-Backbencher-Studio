# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Approach
This project performs sentiment analysis using machine learning models. The workflow includes data cleaning, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and prediction demo.

## Tools Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook = google colab for best useage)
- pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, spaCy, matplotlib, seaborn

## Steps
1. **Data Preparation**:
	- Load the dataset using pandas.
	- Clean the text: remove HTML tags, punctuation, numbers, convert to lowercase, and remove stopwords (NLTK or spaCy).
	- Optionally, perform stemming or lemmatization.
	- Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using scikit-learn.

2. **Model Training**:
	- Convert text to features using TF-IDF (`TfidfVectorizer`) or word embeddings.
	- Train a classification model (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or SVM).
	- Save the trained model as `.pkl` using pickle or joblib.

3. **Evaluation**:
	- Predict on the test set.
	- Report accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score using scikit-learn's `classification_report`.
	- Visualize the confusion matrix using matplotlib or seaborn.
	- Tune hyperparameters for better accuracy.

4. **Demo**:
	- Use the demo cell to input a sentence and get sentiment prediction from the trained model.

5. **Bonus**:
	- Optionally, try a deep learning model (e.g., LSTM with TensorFlow or PyTorch) and compare results.

## Example Workflow in Notebook
1. Import Libraries
2. Load and Clean Data
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize class distribution, word clouds, etc. (optional)
4. Feature Engineering
5. Model Training
6. Evaluation
7. Save Model
8. Demo Cell for Prediction
9. (Optional) Deep Learning Model

## Results
- See the notebook for metrics and visualizations.

## Dataset
- Original and cleaned datasets are included.

## How to Run
- Open `Main task.ipynb` in Jupyter [ google colab].
- Run all cells.
- Use the demo cell to test predictions.
