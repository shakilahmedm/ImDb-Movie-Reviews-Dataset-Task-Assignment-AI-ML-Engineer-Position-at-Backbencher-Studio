# Bonus Readme: Deep Learning Model

## Overview
This project demonstrates a deep learning model using provided training and test data. The workflow is organized in a Jupyter notebook (`bonus-optional-deep-learning-model.ipynb`).

## Structure
- `bonus-optional-deep-learning-model.ipynb`: Main notebook containing code, explanations, and results.
- `data/`: Directory containing datasets and archives.
  - `archive.zip`: Compressed data archive.
  - `test_data (1).csv`: Test dataset.
  - `used as train_data (1).csv`: Training dataset.

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter ( best for kaggle).
2. Ensure the data files are present in the `data/` folder.
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to train and evaluate the model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Common deep learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)

## Notes
- Modify paths in the notebook if your data files are located elsewhere.
- Results and model performance will depend on the provided datasets.
